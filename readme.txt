Linkbacks Redone

== Description ==

This plugin is an attempt to make major changes to linkbacks infrastructure in WordPress. 
It is based off of core code as well as the work previously done by Matthias Pfefferle and
others. It uses the REST API to create a webmention endpoint.

The hope is that this will be a model for a possible inclusion of webmentions and pingbacks
improvements in WordPress core. Any ideas out of this version will hopefully be backported
to the other plugins.
